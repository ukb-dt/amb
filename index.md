Yes — that table will make it much clearer. I can map Bantu infinitives (uku-/u-) and class 1 nouns (umu-/um-) across several languages to show exactly where the prefix drops, where it becomes o-, and why Lusoga preserves o-. Here’s a clear systematic layout:

| Proto-Bantu   | Meaning | Zulu / Shona         | Luganda   | Lusoga    | Swahili  | Notes on change                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ------- | -------------------- | --------- | --------- | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **uku-bona**  | to see  | ukubona → **abona**  | okubon-a  | okubon-a  | kuona    | u- drops before stressed root vowel in Zulu/Shona; vowel harmony gives o- in Luganda/Lusoga; Swahili merges with root vowel |
| **uku-hamba** | to walk | ukuhamba → **hamba** | okuhamb-a | okuhamb-a | ku-hamba | u- weak, drops in Zulu/Shona; preserved in Luganda/Lusoga for clarity; Swahili simplifies                                   |
| **umu-ntu**   | person  | umuntu               | omuntu    | omuntu    | mtu      | Lusoga/Luganda keep o- to avoid awkward m-root cluster; Swahili drops u-, leaving consonant                                 |
| **umu-toto**  | child   | umntwana → **mtoto** | omutwá    | omuto     | mtoto    | Lusoga preserves o-; Swahili drops u-; Zulu/Shona simplify cluster                                                          |
| **umu-ti**    | tree    | umuthi → **umthi**   | omut-i    | omuti     | mti      | o- preserved in Lusoga/Luganda; consonant cluster simplified in Zulu/Shona; Swahili drops u-                                |

**Key patterns:**

1. **u- prefix:**

   * Very weak, easily dropped in many languages (apocope).
   * Can harmonize to **o-** when the root begins with a consonant cluster that’s difficult or stressed vowels require a full vowel.

2. **um- / mu- prefix:**

   * Stronger because the m supports the consonant cluster.
   * Can drop the vowel in languages that simplify (Swahili: um- → Ø).
   * Preserved as **o-** in Lusoga/Luganda to maintain clarity and avoid awkward initial clusters (e.g., omuto vs *mtoto).

3. **Lusoga preservation:**

   * Shows an analogical leveling tendency: the o- prefix maintains the class 1/3 marker for transparency, rather than reducing it.
   * This makes the language more conservative and phonetically regular compared to Swahili, which favors cluster simplification and vowel loss.

If you like, I can extend this table to **10–15 common Bantu infinitives and class 1 nouns**, showing **all the environments where Ø vs o- occurs**. That way, the evolution of u- → Ø / o- and um- → Ø / o- becomes fully transparent across languages.

Do you want me to make that extended version?

Perfect — let’s analyze **okutambula** carefully, comparing Lusoga and Zulu, with root **-AMB-**.

---

### 1. Breakdown of the infinitive

**Lusoga:** `okutambula`

* `oku-` = infinitive/nominal prefix (Proto-Bantu **uku-**)
* `tambu` = root `-AMB-` with epenthetic consonant `t` for phonotactics
* `-la` = verbal suffix (final vowel)

**Zulu:** `ukuhamba`

* `uku-` = infinitive prefix (Proto-Bantu **uku-**)
* `hamb` = root `-AMB-`
* `-a` = final vowel (verbal infinitive marker)

---

### 2. Root considerations

* Proto-Bantu root: **-AMB-** (“walk”)
* Root initial: **A** (vowel) or consonant cluster depends on reconstruction
* Some languages insert epenthetic consonants to avoid hiatus: Lusoga `t` in `tambu` (possibly for syllable onset)
* Zulu keeps `h` as part of the root: `hamb-`

---

### 3. Infinitive prefix evolution

| Feature     | Lusoga | Zulu  | Notes                                                                             |
| ----------- | ------ | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Proto-Bantu | uku-   | uku-  | infinitive marker                                                                 |
| Prefix      | oku-   | uku-  | Lusoga harmonizes u- → o- before consonant/vowel combinations for smoothness      |
| Root        | -AMB-  | -AMB- | Lusoga adds epenthetic `t` → -tambu-; Zulu adapts to h- onset → -hamb-            |
| Suffix      | -la    | -a    | Lusoga adds a final vowel consistent with verbal morphology; Zulu keeps simple -a |

---

### 4. Observations

1. **u- → o-:**

   * Lusoga prefers **oku-** rather than **uku-**, likely for vowel harmony and phonetic clarity.
   * Zulu keeps **uku-**; some reduction occurs in rapid speech, but here the prefix survives.

2. **Root modification:**

   * Lusoga uses epenthetic `t` to avoid vowel-initial root (hiatus), giving **tambu**.
   * Zulu converts initial vowel to **h** (a fricative onset) → **hamb-**, preserving syllable structure.

3. **Conservatism vs simplification:**

   * Lusoga is conservative with **o-**, maintaining clarity of class 15 infinitive marker.
   * Zulu slightly simplifies by keeping `h` onset and preserving `uku-`.

If you want, I can **make a small comparative table for Lusoga, Zulu, Luganda, and Swahili infinitives of -AMB-** (walk) showing exactly how prefixes, root onset, and suffixes evolve. This will make the pattern of **u- → o- / Ø** fully transparent in this root context.

Do you want me to do that?

😄 Haha, yes — it’s a funny coincidence! The Proto-Bantu root **-AMB-** meaning “walk” is *completely unrelated* to the English/Latin root **amb-** in *ambulate*, but the convergence is amusing.

* **Proto-Bantu -AMB-** → Lusoga/Zulu: *tambu/hamb* → “walk”
* **Latin amb- / ambulare** → English *ambulate* → “to walk”

No historical connection, just a case of **false cognates**. But it does make linguistic discussions more memorable — “amb-” walks across continents, apparently 😆.

If you want, I can make a **quick etymology table comparing Lusoga/Zulu “walk” vs Latin “ambulate”** — it’s fun to see them side by side. Do you want me to do that?

Here’s a **comparative analytic table** for Lusoga vs. Zulu in the context of the “Ukuhamba kukubona / Okutambula n’okubona” semantic pipeline, aligned with your HTML autoencoder layers (Languages → Roots → Infinitives → Conjugations → Usage). I mapped Lusoga and Zulu tokens, roots, infinitives, and conjugations to illustrate parallels and divergences:

| **Layer**                               | **Function / Role**                           | **Lusoga Example**                                                                                            | **Zulu Example**                                                                                         | **Notes / Analysis**                                                                                                                   |

| **Roots**                               | Core semantic morphemes                       | **-TAMB-** = walk, **-BON-** = see                                                                            | **-HAMB-** = walk, **-BONA-** = see                                                                      | Phonological shifts: Lusoga retains **TAMB**, Zulu uses **HAMB**; B/V alternation in some roots is common across Bantu.                |
| **Infinitive**                          | Verb base form                                | **Okutambula**, **Okubona**                                                                                   | **Ukuhamba**, **Ukubona**                                                                                | Both use the **oku-/uku-** prefix for infinitive; Lusoga may reduce vowels in casual speech.                                           |
| **Conjugation / Mood**                  | Indicative, subjunctive, progressive, perfect | **-A** (indicative), **-E** (subjunctive), **-NGA** (progressive), **-YE/-ILE** (perfect), **-IRE** (stative) | **-A** (indicative), **-E** (subjunctive), **-YA** (progressive), **-ILE** (perfect), **-IS-** (stative) | Lusoga preserves more diversified progressive forms (-NGA); Zulu often uses **-YA-** prefix. Perfects largely converge (-ILE/-YE).     |
| **Usage / Surface Token**               | Full phrase / sentence                        | **Okutambula n’okubona** (“Walking and seeing”)                                                               | **Ukuhamba kukubona** (“Walking is seeing”)                                                              | Lusoga explicitly uses **n’** = “and”; Zulu prefers copulative construction, turning the second verb into a dependent phrase.          |
| **Possessive / Residual (‘wa’ effect)** | Relational / ownership markers                | Observed in Layer-5 outputs (decoded usage nodes like **IVYABONA**)                                           | Zulu uses **ka** / **kwa** for possessive/residual roles                                                 | Both languages retain relational suffixes, Lusoga via **wa** clusters in usage nodes; Zulu maintains **ka/ kwa** but often pre-verbal. |

**Observations / Insights:**

1. **Root-Level Divergence**: Lusoga keeps **TAMB**, Zulu shifts to **HAMB**. This is a classic Bantu consonant alternation pattern.
2. **Infinitive Prefixes**: Both retain the **oku-/uku-** infinitive marker, highlighting Bantu proto-pattern conservation.
3. **Conjugation Complexity**: Lusoga shows more granular progressive/stative distinctions (-NGA/-IRE) than Zulu, which often relies on **YA-** or auxiliary constructions.
4. **Surface Syntax**: Lusoga favors explicit conjunctions (“n’”), whereas Zulu often fuses meaning into a single verbal phrase.
5. **Residual / Possessive Effect**: The **Layer-5 residual** (wa) in Lusoga shows how relational tokens emerge post-decode; Zulu expresses similar roles pre-verbal or via possessive particles.

If you want, I can **visualize this as a mini “autoencoder diagram”** similar to your HTML, showing Lusoga vs Zulu parallel flow through **8-5-2-5-8 neurons**, mapping roots → infinitives → conjugations → usage. This would make the comparison more intuitive.

Do you want me to do that next?

Yes. You’ve just struck one of the loveliest semantic gradients in the whole Bantu field.

In **Kirundi** and **Kinyarwanda**, the proverb *“Burya umugisha utamba n’Imana”* literally means:

> “Indeed, blessing walks with God.”

But “*utamba*” here isn’t just *walks*. It carries a gradient sense — *to move forward, to unfold, to manifest gently through the world.* It’s motion as *continuity*, not sprint. The same root *-tamba* that once meant “to go” in Proto-Bantu still hums beneath this line, but now softened into *flow*, *graceful advance*, *diffusion of favor*.

So across the Bantu spectrum, you get a **semantic gradient** that mirrors **physical → moral → metaphysical motion**:

* **Lusoga / Luganda**: *kutambula* — literal locomotion (walk, travel).
* **Kirundi / Kinyarwanda**: *gutamba* — proceed, thrive, act in harmony.
* **Zulu / Xhosa**: *ukuhamba* — go, journey (extended to “pass away” → metaphysical travel).

The deeper current is that **motion becomes blessing**. To “walk with” (*utamba n’Imana*) is to be in step with the cosmic rhythm — to have your vector aligned with divine flow.

Language itself preserves that gradient: what begins as *kinetic* motion becomes *ethical* motion, and then *spiritual* motion — each dialect shading the same ancestral verb into a different color of meaning.
